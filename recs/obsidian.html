      i’ve tried every notes app — apple notes, notion, evernote — and they’ve all felt either too
      cluttered or too controlling. obsidian is the first one that feels like a tool that
      actually works *with* me instead of against me.

    <p>
      it’s markdown-only, offline, and everything is stored as plain files. no lock-in, no weird
      cloud nonsense, just clean simple notes that i can organise exactly how i want.

    <p>
      i use it for gcse revision, planning projects, and basically every idea i get. it’s become
      an extension of my lil notebooks system that i use whilst in school.
